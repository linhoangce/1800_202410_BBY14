# Comp 1800 - Burnaby 14

## 1. Project Description
Our team BBY14 including Isaac, Joey, and Linh is developing Farmify, a commercial app that connects farmers directly with  consumers to reduce the cost and time spent buying fresh and healthy produce while supporting local, small-scale farms that contributes to our community's sustainability and increase the farmers' profit share. 
Users can now create a post, write their reviews, bookmark their favorites, add items to their carts, and send a message to the farms.
Users can also enjoy better experience using the app thanks to improved UI design, add items to cart with the price calculated and go to checkout page, review and leave star rating for each post, view their current location with Google map on our app, unsave bookmarks.

## 4. Complete setup/installion/usage
Due to our project being at an early stage and limited time and personel, we have not been able to design to accomodate bigger screen size on computers, laptops or various other devices. Our design focus has always been designing for mobile first. And we chose Iphone 14 Promax screen size for this project UI design. Therefore, to enjoy the best UI/UX, please adjust your screen size to Iphone 14 Promax when using our web app. 
Here are some simple instructions.
* Go to our landing page from this link: https://comp1800-bby14-b87af.web.app/
* Right click anywhere on the web page
* Select Inspect at the bottom of the menu (or press F12 on your keyboard) to view developer mode.
* Select the 2nd icon, which looks like a computer with a phone, from the left next to the icon with an arrow pointing right-up.
* On the top control bar above the app, click on Dimensions: and select iPhone14 Promax.
* Now you can view or app with the latest UI updates.
* You can create a fake account in the format of an email to log in, for example user@bcit.ca, fill out your name and password.
* Optionally, if you need bigger screen size because the default screen size is too small for you, please unselect the computer with phone icon, and adjust the screen size as you wish. Our recommendation is 460 x 695 pixel to maintain relatively proper UI elements.
* After logging in, you can try different features that we have been able to implement so far.
* Finally, we would love to hear about your experience or feedback, please help us complete a small survey on this link. 
Thank you, I hope you will enjoy using our app.
